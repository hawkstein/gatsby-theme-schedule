## Gatsby Theme Schedule Example

This is a very simple example of a Gatsby site using `@hawkstein/gatsby-theme-schedule` without setting many options, using much MDX or shadowing any files. All very default.

Please see the main (README)[https://www.github.com/hawkstein/gatsby-theme-schedule/README.md] for configuration options.
